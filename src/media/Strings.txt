Hello there, I'm new to these parts. Being a former professional Chef, I used
to cook glorious meals for foreign guests visiting Kruger National Park in
Southern Africa. With the onset of the Pandemic in 2020, I grabbed the opportunity
to enter the world of IT. Currently I am a support engineer working mostly with VoIP and
Networking. My thirst for knowledge stays unsatiated. With copious amounts of coffee in my system,
and the ever unsratchable parts of my brain, I plan to become a powerhouse of a developer.
My Journey has started.

For myself it's straightforward; "Change the world one step at a time."
I want to create tools that improve the productivity of the average worker.
I want to optimise the most expensive commodity in this world... time.
Finally, I want to inspire and cultivate a whole generation to approach 
the world with a different perspective. There is greatness in all of us.
I want to harness it, that we can all benefit from it.

I need to establish a proper foothold as a developer and create meaningful relationships with various experts in different tech stacks.
I want to collaborate and hone my skills, learn as much as I can along the way. Every day I have to either improve on something I already know, or learn
something new. My mission is to Jam 10 year's worth of Experience and Wisdom in my Brain within 5 Years.The next generation is not getting any younger.
I have to be ready for the day when I have to pass on the torch.
